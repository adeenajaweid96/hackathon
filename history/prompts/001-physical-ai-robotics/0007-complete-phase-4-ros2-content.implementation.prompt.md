## Response snapshot

Successfully completed all tasks in Phase 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book:

1. **T023 [P] [US2] Create ROS 2 fundamentals chapter outline**: Created comprehensive directory structure and four foundational documents covering ROS 2 architecture, nodes/topics/services, building packages, and URDF robot description.

2. **T024 [P] [US2] Write ROS 2 architecture and concepts content**: Created detailed ros-2-architecture.md covering ROS 2 concepts, architecture, communication patterns, and implementation examples.

3. **T025 [P] [US2] Document Python-based ROS 2 node development**: Included comprehensive Python examples in nodes-topics-services.md with proper implementation patterns.

4. **T026 [P] [US2] Explain rclpy integration and usage**: Integrated rclpy examples throughout the nodes-topics-services document.

5. **T027 [P] [US2] Create NVIDIA Jetson deployment guide**: Created comprehensive jetson-deployment-guide.md covering Jetson setup, optimization, and deployment strategies.

6. **T028 [P] [US2] Add sensor data processing tutorials**: Created comprehensive sensor-data-processing.md with examples for image processing, LiDAR, sensor fusion, and optimization techniques.

7. **T029 [P] [US2] Document ROS 2 communication patterns**: Thoroughly documented communication patterns in nodes-topics-services.md with visual diagrams and examples.

8. **T030 [P] [US2] Create practical exercises for ROS 2 development**: Included hands-on exercises and knowledge checkpoints in all ROS 2 fundamentals documents.

9. **T031 [P] [US2] Add troubleshooting section for common ROS 2 issues**: Created comprehensive troubleshooting-ros2.md with diagnostic tools, systematic approaches, and best practices.

Updated the sidebar to include all new documents and marked all Phase 4 tasks as completed in the tasks.md file.
