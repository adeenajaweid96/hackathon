## Prompt

Complete all remaining tasks in Phase 5: [US3] Gazebo & Isaac Sim Environment Setup - Book Content. The remaining tasks were:
- T037 [P] [US3] Document NVIDIA Isaac Sim integration
- T038 [P] [US3] Add Unity integration content
- T039 [P] [US3] Create synthetic data generation tutorials
- T040 [P] [US3] Add exercises for simulation environments

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed all remaining tasks in Phase 5 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book:

1. **T037 [P] [US3] Document NVIDIA Isaac Sim integration**: Added comprehensive Isaac Sim integration content to unity-robot-visualization.md covering installation, features, ROS 2 bridge, and best practices.

2. **T038 [P] [US3] Add Unity integration content**: Enhanced unity-robot-visualization.md with extensive Unity robotics content including setup, modeling, materials, lighting, and ROS integration.

3. **T039 [P] [US3] Create synthetic data generation tutorials**: Added comprehensive synthetic data generation content to sensor-simulation.md with domain randomization, pipelines, and best practices.

4. **T040 [P] [US3] Add exercises for simulation environments**: Added practical exercises to all four Gazebo simulation documents (setting-up-gazebo.md, urdf-sdf-simulation-files.md, unity-robot-visualization.md, and sensor-simulation.md).

All Phase 5 tasks (T032-T040) are now marked as completed in the tasks.md file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed entire Phase 5 with comprehensive simulation content for humanoid robotics applications
- 🧪 Tests: All documents created with practical examples, exercises, and implementation guides
- 📁 Files: 5 files updated across documentation and configuration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase 6 Vision-Language-Action content
- 🧠 Reflection: The simulation section is now comprehensive with Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, and synthetic data generation coverage

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with Phase 6 content creation
