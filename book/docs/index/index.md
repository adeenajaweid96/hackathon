# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational resource for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This AI-native textbook is designed to guide you through the essential concepts, technologies, and practical implementations needed to understand and develop advanced robotic systems.

## Course Overview

This course covers the complete spectrum of humanoid robotics development, from fundamental principles to advanced implementation. You'll learn about:

- **Physical AI Fundamentals**: Understanding embodied intelligence and multi-modal integration
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: Developing with ROS 2 for robot applications
- **Simulation & Digital Twins**: Creating virtual environments for testing and training
- **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**: Leveraging GPU-accelerated robotics frameworks
- **Humanoid Development**: Kinematics, dynamics, locomotion, and manipulation
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Integrating perception, cognition, and action
- **Capstone Project**: Building an autonomous humanoid robot

## Learning Path

The course is structured in progressive modules that build upon each other:

1. **Foundation**: Start with Physical AI concepts and basic robotics principles
2. **Development**: Learn ROS 2 and robot development frameworks
3. **Simulation**: Master simulation tools for safe robot development
4. **Specialization**: Deep dive into humanoid-specific technologies
5. **Integration**: Combine all concepts in the capstone project

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic electronics knowledge (helpful but not required)

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Introduction to Physical AI](/docs/intro-to-physical-ai/intro-to-physical-ai) module to understand the fundamental concepts, then progress through the structured curriculum at your own pace.
